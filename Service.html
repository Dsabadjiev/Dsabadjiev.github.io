		<h2>Pi Day Math Tournament</h2>
		<!-- <img class="r" alt="This is a picture of our STEM II device." src="images/appfair2.jpg"> -->
		<p>
			The annual AMSA-MAMS Pi Day Math Tournament (PDMT) is an all-day math competition 
			for middle school students around Pi Day and organized by high school students from Mass 
			Academy and AMSA. This was the third year that the competition ran, and I wrote 
			problems for the competition both this year and last year. Working with my peers to 
			write problems for middle schoolers was surprisingly fun, and it was also different to 
			be on the problem-writing end, as I am usually the one doing the problems. This year I 
			also took a more active roll and was head proctor, which meant that I directed 
			students participating in the competition. PDMT was an overall great experience, and it was really 
			fun to work with kids and help with the event.

		<h2>Extending Water Root</h2>
		<img class="r" alt="This is a picture of our STEM II device." src="images/appfair2.jpg">
		<p>
			Various people expressed interest in my group’s <a href="STEMII.html">STEM II project</a>, 
			so we are  building more devices so that more people can use our device. Though the 
			process of making more mechanical devices is straightforward, integrating the devices 
			with separate applications will require additional work. Currently, the app is directly 
			connected to a firebase database which connects to an Arduino, but for another device we 
			would probably have to make another app and link it with a new database so that the 
			apps control different devices. We could also extend the project to find a more elegant 
			solution to multiple devices or expand the functionality.

		<h2>Worcester Tree Initiative</h2>
		<p>
			This summer I also plan to volunteer at the <a href="http://www.treeworcester.org">Worcester 
			Tree Initiative</a>. The Worcester Tree Initiative is an organization to promote 
			planting and caring for trees in Worcester. It began with replanting the trees lost in 
			Worcester to the Asian Longhorned Beetle, but grew into an organization to make 
			Worcester’s forests better than before and provide the natural benefits of a forest in 
			the city. I am planning on helping with weeding and mulching this summer.
