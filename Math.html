		In Math Modeling, we learn about a variety of different topics, including some number 
		theory and precalculus. I am also self-studying for the AP BC Calculus exam. The 
		curriculum is focused on doing problems to motivate mathematical ideas, and there are many 
		labs which involve solving problems and writing the solutions in Mathematica. One such problem 
		was the Egg Problem, which addressed solving simultaneous modular equations. My write up 
		is shown below.

		Our school also participated in HiMCM, the High School Math Competition in Modelling. This 
		is a contest where a group of 3-4 students writes a mathematical modelling paper addressing 
		one of two open-ended problems. My group chose Problem A, which asked us to develop a 
		mathematical strategy to rate roller coasters and determine the best roller coaster based 
		on data from a given database and additional data found online. We chose this problem 
		because it seemed more interesting and fun. We also had to design an 
		app to rate roller coasters (without actually coding it). My group developed a “sub-score” 
		for each roller coaster criteria we chose to consider, which was calculated based on a 
		roller coaster’s value for a property and the distance from the desired value. We then took 
		a weighted average of the sub-scores to get the roller coaster’s score. Our paper is shown 
		below.
