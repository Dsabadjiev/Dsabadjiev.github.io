		For STEM II, everyone has a group project designing an assistive device to help a client 
		with a disability. I worked in a group of three to make the process of watering a kitchen 
		house plant accessible by designing a garden maintenance system that would promote gardening 
		independence for people with limited mobility. My group combined our apps for good project 
		and our STEM II project, so we integrated software with hardware. The hardware consisted of 
		the mechanical device which delivers water to a plant via a showerhead and the physical 
		electronics to power and control the device, while the software consisted of an Android 
		application and Arduino code to control the electronics. I worked mainly on the electronics 
		and processing data with Firebase, a cloud database service. A picture of the device is 
		shown to the right and a pdf of the poster is shown below.

	<p>
		The electronics consisted of a wall adapter that provided 12 V DC to power a circuit which 
		then powered a NodeMCU board. The board was in turn connected to a pump and a moisture 
		sensor. The board accessed Firebase and powered the pump and reported the moisture when 
		commanded by certain Firebase variables. A diagram of the electronics is shown to the left. 
		The mechanical portion consisted of a Lexan plate attached to a 
		stand with a showerhead.  The showerhead was designed to distribute water throughout the 
		plant.
