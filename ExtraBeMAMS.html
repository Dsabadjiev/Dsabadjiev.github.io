			I have taken piano lessons since the age of 5 with Nune Hakobyan. She gives me classical
			 piano music from various composers, and I have played with other instruments and with a 
			 quartet. Piano has helped me grow as an individual and is also a good way to relieve 
			 stress. 
		</p>
		<!-- This was the text my personal essay for MAMS. I decided not to include it because I 
		wanted my website to be original work. It also did not fit stylistically.
		<p>
			When I first learned to play piano, it was hard. My teacher would touch the keyboard 
			and the music would come out, but when I tried, my fingers would stumble and produce 
			cacophony. Over and over, she told me I just had to practice more. Rationally, I knew 
			that to be true, but I was too young to really remember, and the only thing that 
			worked was my parents pushing me to practice. With practice, I slowly learned, and the
			 increased skill of my hands allowed me to produce music. 
		</p><p>
			However, the initiative was not fully mine, so neither was the full appreciation of the
			 fruit. I enjoyed playing the songs I already knew, but not enough to practice a new 
			 piece without my parents’ needling. I learned much, but there was always some 
			 grudgingness to playing piano because my parents made me. Eventually, music demanded 
			 more. For one concert, my teacher had decided to have me play two difficult movements 
			 of a sonata. Though I learned the first one well enough, the second movement was fast 
			 and technically demanding. By the time of the concert I could not master it and only 
			 played the first movement. I had failed. It did not seem so bad at first, but as time 
			 went on, the dissatisfaction of not living up to my potential kept resurfacing. 
		</p><p>
			Meanwhile, I learned another lesson from math. I had always been good at math in 
			elementary school, but I was never really challenged. When I came to AMSA, I suddenly 
			wasn’t the only one at an advanced level, nor was I the best. I had peers who 
			encouraged me to delve deeper, and math class became more stimulating. I found that I 
			had not really applied myself before, and suddenly, when I did, I grew. I also started 
			exploring math and science on my own, as some of my friends had, and started learning 
			intriguing things that I never would have otherwise encountered.
		</p><p>
			I realized I could apply this same concept to music. Instead of always waiting until my
			 parents nagged me to play, I started to practice piano of my own accord. My teacher 
			 gave me a three-movement Concerto by Haydn, which seemed overwhelming at first, but 
			 soon learning it became a joy in and of itself. In the end, my hard work paid off, and
			  I played the whole Concerto with pride. This time though, the learning was my own, as
			   I had put in the work of my own volition; the harvest had been gathered of my own 
			   efforts.

			The video on the right is from a piano concerto I played recently. More videos can be 
			found on the same channel (my brother's youtube channel).

		<h2>Theatre</h2>
		<p>
			Lucky 10 is a singing and theater group I was involved in for two years in middle school.
			We performed various songs from Jewish Musical Theater, as well as the opera 
			<span class="italics">The 
			Wedding of Figaro</span>, in which I played Count Almaviva, and the musical 
			<span class="italics">Annie</span>, in which I 
			played Oliver Warbucks. As well as acting, this program included voice lessons.
		</p>
		<p>
			I was involved in many theatrical productions at
			<a href="http://www.mosesianarts.org/index.php/childrens-theater ">
				Watertown Children’s Theatre (WCT) 
			</a>  
			in elementary school. Though I stopped participating in WCT in middle school, I was 
			involved in a production of the musical Assassins in 10th grade.

		This is a section for the activities at my sending school, the Advanced Math and Science

		<h2>Math Team</h2>
		<img class="l" alt="This is a picture of AMSA's Freshman Math Team." src="images/Fresh_Math_Team.jpg">
		<p>
			I have been part of math team since 7th grade. In 9th and 10th grade, we participated 
			in the Worcester County Mathematics League (WOCOMAL). In
			9th grade, I was 10th individually and our team was #1 in Freshman WOCOMAL, while in 
			Varsity WOCOMAL I was in the top 100 individually and our team placed first at the MAML
			 state’s championship in the small school division. In 10th grade, our school competed in Varsity
			  WOCOMAL again, and I placed 15th individually, while our team placed first again in 
			  WOCOMAL. I also participated in various other math competitions such as November HMMT
			 and PUMaC (power round only). 
		</p>
		<p>
			In 10th grade, I was Vice President of Varsity Math Team. This role helped me develop my
			 leadership qualities and helped me understand some of the many responsibilities of 
			running a club. I also wrote problems for PDMT, a middle school competition run by 
			students from MAMS and AMSA, and AMSA’s Gauss Day competition, a local competition at 
			my sending school to inspire 6th and 7th graders to hone their math skills or join 
			math team.

		<h2>A Cappella</h2>
		<p>
			I was involved in the Photosymphonizers, AMSA’s A Cappella group in 9th and 10th grade,
			 at my sending school. Our team participated in the International Competition for High 
			School A Cappella (ICHSA). Though our team was not extremely competitive, the 
			Photosymphonizers were a great community.
