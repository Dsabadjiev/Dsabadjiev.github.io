		In Computer Science, I am in the advanced track because I took AP CSA at AMSA before coming 
		to MAMS. In the beginning of the year, everyone made websites together, but in October we 
		started java and I started working on an exploratory CS project. The goal of my project is 
		to develop an android app with a virtual deck of cards which can be manipulated however the 
		users wish. I started this project last year, but though I made the basic classes for a 
		card, a deck, a player, and had a couple of simple games, the app was almost entirely text 
		based. This year I am improving the user interface by letting the users drag animated cards 
		around and deal cards to different players. The app will also allow users to create a basic 
		game where they can decide how many players there are, what cards each player starts with, 
		and move the cards around between players as they wish. Currently, I have a version which 
		has some bugs and only allows for these parameters to be changed manually in the code. You 
		can download my current version <a href="docs/SimpleCardsUI.zip" download=""> here </a>or 
		see the screenshot to the right. You will need android studio to run the app.
	</p>

		Our school also participates in ACSL, the American Computer Science League. I am competing 
		in the senior division, and for the first round I had to write a program that found the sum 
		of all n-digit numbers formed from a big number less than 10^50. My solution to this 
		problem can be downloaded  <a href="docs/ACSLProblem.java" download="">here.</a> You will 
		need a java environment to run the program, such as eclipse, but you can view the file as a
		pdf below.

		For roughly the last quarter of the year everyone participates in the apps for good 
		program, which involves designing a mobile application for the good of the 
		community. I worked in a group of three to make the process of watering a kitchen 
		house plant accessible by designing a garden maintenance system that would promote gardening 
		independence for people with limited mobility. My group combined our apps for good project 
		and our <a href="STEMII.html">STEM II</a>  project, so we integrated software with hardware. The hardware consisted of 
		the mechanical device which delivers water to a plant via a showerhead and the physical 
		electronics to power and control the device, while the software consisted of an Android 
		application and Arduino code to control the electronics. I worked mainly on the electronics 
		and processing data with Firebase, a cloud database service. A picture of the device is 
		shown to the right and a pdf of the poster is shown below.

	<p>
		The Android application had a button which allowed the user to water the plants by changing 
		command variables in the online Firebase database according to the userâ€™s presses. 
		There was also a timer feature that allowed the user to water the device automatically, 
		along with a water log to store previous watering, links to research websites and 
		instructions documentation, and a page which allowed the user to check and log the moisture 
		sensed by a moisture sensor. The Arduino code allowed the NodeMCU board to listen to the 
		command variables in Firebase and turn the pump on or off and report the moisture when 
		instructed. There was some difficulty connecting the NodeMCU board with Firebase, but it 
		was eventually resolved.
