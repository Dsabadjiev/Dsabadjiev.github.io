		For STEM I, everyone has an independent research project, and my project was on integrating 
		sonification into education, specifically into a lesson on joint and combined variation. 
		Sonification is the process of translating data into sound to generate “sound graphs” or 
		audio feedback. My hope was that these sound graphs would help students get a feel for 
		joint and combined variation the way visual graphs can help students understand direct and 
		inverse variation and would be more effective than visual graphs because joint and combined 
		variation handles multivariate data. For my testing, I had a pair of google forms which 
		each had a couple surveys, tests, and a video lesson on joint and combined variation.

		to see the form with the lesson with sonification. I tested 20 juniors from Mass Academy 
		and 18 seventh graders from AMSA. Though the pretest and posttest scores for AMSA students 
		suggested that sonification may lead to better improvement, I did not have enough data 
		to show a significant link.  In mid-December, we had a practice science fair where everyone 
		presented their research up to that point, and in mid-February we had a local science fair 
		where we presented our projects to a panel of judges and to the public. My STEM thesis, 
		which summarizes my research, is shown below.
